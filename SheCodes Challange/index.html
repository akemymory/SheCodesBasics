        CrossFit is a high-intensity fitness training program that combines
        elements from various disciplines such as cardiovascular conditioning,
        weightlifting, gymnastics, and functional movements. It was created by
        Greg Glassman in 2000 and has gained significant popularity as a
        training methodology and sport.

        CrossFit workouts can include activities like weightlifting, running,
        rowing, bodyweight exercises, kettlebell training, and more. They are
        typically performed at a high intensity and are designed to challenge
        multiple muscle groups and energy systems in a single session. CrossFit
        places a strong emphasis on functional movements, which are exercises
        that mimic real-life activities and help improve daily life activities
        and overall athleticism.
      </p>
      <p>
        CrossFit also has a competitive aspect with events like the CrossFit
        Games, which is an annual competition to find the "Fittest on Earth."
        Athletes from around the world compete in a variety of challenging
        workouts to showcase their strength, endurance, and overall fitness
        level.
